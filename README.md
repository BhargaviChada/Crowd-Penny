# Crowd Penny
* A decentralised crowdfunding platform based on the Ethereum blockchain.  
* The project aims to solve the issue of people abusing funds gained through traditional crowdfunding sites.
* The blockchain aids in keeping track of the money received through the application,reducing the chances of exploitation of funds.
* The campaigns can be created by providing a minimum contribution requirement.
* The creator of the campaign can propose how the money should be spent and how much is needed by making a 'Request'. 
* Everyone who has contributed to the campaign will be allowed to approve or deny every Spending Request.
* After more than half of the contributors approve, the creator can finalize the Request.
